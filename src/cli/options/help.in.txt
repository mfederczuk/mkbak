    Creates a gzipped tarball archive containing the given PATHs.
    Contents of directories are included recursively.

    If a directory contains a '.nobak' file, the contents of that directory will be excluded, except when explicitly
    added.
    If a directory contains a '.nobakpattern' file, the patterns to exclude relative to that directory are read from
    this file. Patterns are separated by newlines.

    When no PATHs were given and neither the --input nor the --crontab options were specified, the default input file
    will be used that is specified in the config file.
    When no default input file is configured, the program will fail.

    Options:
      -i, --input=<file>      Read paths to archive from FILE. Paths are separated with newlines.
                              When FILE is '-', read from stdin.

      -o, --output=<file>     Write archive to FILE.
                              When FILE is '-', write to stdout.
                              Default is '<year>-<month>-<day>.tar.gz'.

      -n, --crontab           Also archive the user's crontab. (default)
      -N, --no-crontab        Don't archive the user's crontab.

      -p, --copy=<dest>       Copy archive to DEST. DEST can be either a directory or file.
                              This option can be specified multiple times.
                              When the --output option is specified as '-' all --copy options are ignored.

#ignore

        temporarily ignored while the transient backups feature is deactivated:

      -t, --transient         Make a transient backup. Ignored when --output is specified as '-'.
      -T, --no-transient      Don't make a transient backup. (default)
          --list-transients   List all currently saved transient backups and exit.
          --clear-transients  Clear all currently saved transient backups and exit.

#end-ignore
      -h, --help              Show this summary and exit successfully.
      -V, --version           Show version and legal information and exit successfully.

    Config:
      The mkbak config file is located at '\$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mkbak/mkbak.conf'.
      It's simple key-value dictionary storage using the equals character ('=') as the key-value separator.
      The following keys are recognized:

        default_input_file_path (string/path)
            The default input file to use when otherwise no paths to archive are given.

#ignore

        temporarily ignored while the transient backups feature is deactivated:

        max_transient_backups (integer)
            The amount of transient backups to keep cached at the same time.

    Transient Backups:
      With the --transient option, the created archive will be a "transient backup".

      The location of transient backup archives are cached in mkbak's cache directory. (\$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mkbak)
      Once the maximum amount of transient backups is reached, creating a new transient backup will automatically remove
      the oldest one, both the archive file and the metadata that was cached.

      mkbak locates the archive files of transient backups using three metadata points:

      * the file's original output path
      * the file's hash sum
      * the file's inode number

      Moving the archive file *should* not be a problem, as both the hash sum and inode number will stay the same,
      though mkbak will take longer to execute since the entire filesystem must searched to locate the file again.

      By default, the maximum amount of transient backups that will be kept is 3.
      There is no rationale behind this number, I just felt like using it.
